**Customer churn**, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon in which customers stop doing business with a company. Customer churn is a significant concern for companies, as it can have a significant impact on their bottom line. 
In recent years, a variety of models have been developed to help companies predict and prevent customer churn. 
In this repository, you find all that you need to get started with the Customer Churn Problem using a simple example from Kaggle. We will start with analyzing the data, preprocessing the features, then building the ML models to predict the churn.
